ofxFixtures
=====================================

Addon to use multiple DMX fixtures with stage simulation. Currently a work in progress.


NOTES ON DEFAULT HEAD DEGREES

Default pan range runs from 0° to 360° clockwise as seen looking at the fixture from the bottom of the base towards the yoke, as if the fixture was hanging downwards underneath you.
Tilt range is 0° to 360°, 0° is with the head pointed directly to the base, and moving to the front and then to the rear, and then again to the base. So the fixture points fully forward when pan is set to 90° and tilt is set to 90°.

The routine for following the target works only with tilts from 90° to 270°.
